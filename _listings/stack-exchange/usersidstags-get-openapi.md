  title: Stack Exchange Get User Tags
  description: "Returns the tags the users identified in {ids} have been active in.\n
    \nThis route corresponds roughly to user's stats tab, but does not include tag
    scores. A subset of tag scores are available (on a single user basis) in /users/{id}/top-answer-tags
    and /users/{id}/top-question-tags.\n \n{ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited
    ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.\n
    \nThe sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the tag object:\n
    - popular - count\n - activity - the creation_date of the last question asked
    with the tag\n - name - name\n  popular is the default sort.\n \n It is possible
    to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.\n
    \nThis method returns a list of tags."

        passing tagged=c;java will return only those questions with both tags. As
        such, passing more than 5 tags will always return zero results.\n \nThe sorts
