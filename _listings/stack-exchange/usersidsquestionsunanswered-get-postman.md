    "description": "Gets the questions asked by the users in {ids} which the site consideres unanswered, while still having at least one answer posted.\n \nThese rules are subject to change, but currently any question without at least one upvoted or accepted answer is considered unanswered.\n \nTo get the set of questions that a user probably considers unanswered, the returned questions should be unioned with those returned by /users/{id}/questions/no-answers. These methods are distinct so that truly unanswered (that is, zero posted answers) questions can be easily separated from mearly poorly or inadequately answered ones.\n \n{ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.\n \nThe sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:\n - activity - last_activity_date\n - creation - creation_date\n - votes - score\n  activity is the default sort.\n \n It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.\n \nThis method returns a list of questions.",
